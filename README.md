# Gallery of my life, by Greg

## Description

_Duration: 2 Day Sprint_

This application is built to allow users to save images to a view page where they can click on an image to see a description of it or click a button to add a like for an image. 

I employed Material UI for some styling.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- *Optional [AWS-S3]

## Installation


1. Create a database named `react_gallery`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. Look around
2. Click around
3. Fill out the form at the bottom with url and description for a new photo
4. Click add new photo to save details
